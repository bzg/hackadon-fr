	  <h2>Why Hackadons ?</h2>
	  <p>« A free software is free... once it has been paid. » - François Élie</p>
	</header>

	<p>We fight for a redecentralized Internet.<p>

	<p>Internet Redecentralization has many aspects: it is a
	  technical, legal, political challenge.  But it is also an
	  financial one.</p>

	<p>Too many projets are contributing to free softwares and
	  common goods with no stable financial basis.  Too many
	  projects rely on the good will and the free time of a
	  fistful of contributors.</p>

	<p>Hackadons events help tackling this problem, project by
	  project, donation by donation.</p>
